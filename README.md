### Project Description
User analysis is the process by which we track how users engage and interact with our digital product (software or mobile application) in an attempt to derive business insights for marketing, product & development teams.
These insights are then used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether while helping the business grow.

### Problem
You are working with the product team of Instagram and the product manager has asked me to provide insights on the questions asked by the management team.

### Approach
<p>For this project, I have used My SQL Knowledge  to connect with SQL Server using My SQL Workbench and extracted the required data from the given database using the Join function, subqueries, Aggregation, where Clause, Group by, Distinct and other functions are required.</p>
<p>keeping the Primary key and foreign key in consideration provided all the reports asked by the marketing department and Investor metrics department.</p>
<p>I have used Google sheets and documents for making this presentation as it contains required Elements, Graphs, Images which made this project more attractive.</p>

Based on the results, there are â€“
    so the average will be 257/74 = 3.47, Based on the data. we can say that an average user posts 3-4 times.<br>

### Conclusion 
<p>From this project, I got an idea about how as a business or data analyst we work on real-time data to take and data-driven decisions.
One thing I infer about this project is the dataset provided was very limited and small in respect of Rows and columns, but still, it was a very good experience working on such a project.
It helped me a lot to understand the analysis process well, and to provide insights for the best decision possible.</p>
